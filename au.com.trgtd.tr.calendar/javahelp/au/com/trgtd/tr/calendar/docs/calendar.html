        <h2>Calendar Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            In this category there is an option to publish data to an iCalendar format file.
        </p>
        <p>You can select which type of action you want to export and whether they should appear as
            calendar events or as To Do items. Please note that as of writing (30 March 09) Google Calendar
            does no have To Do item functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please also note that the priority attribute is only set for To Do items.  You will need to specify a mapping
            between your priority values and the iCalendar priority values, in the Criteria screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select the Calendar application you are exporting to (currently there is just the default option).
            The options specific to your selection will be shown in the box below.
        </p>
        <p>Default calendar options are as follows:</p>
        <ul><li>
                <b>Output folder.</b> Allows you to enter or browse for the file system folder
                (directory) where the iCalendar file will be created.  The file will have the same name as the data
            file but with .ics extension.</li>
            <li><b>Time zone.</b> Allows you to specify the time zone.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
