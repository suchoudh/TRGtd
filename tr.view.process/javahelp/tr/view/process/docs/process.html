    <h2>Process Thoughts</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The thoughts collected through the
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.collect/tr/view/collect/docs/collect.html">Collect Thoughts</a>
        screen are displayed one by one, in the same order as entered. A counter indicates how many
        thoughts still need to be processed. If this screen has been called when re-processing an Item
        or Action, or if any &quot;tickled&quot; Someday/Maybe items need to be looked at, the corresponding
        thought will be displayed first.
    </p>
    <p>

        This screen is where you decide what to do with a thought. First of all, you need to decide if
        the thought is actionable or not. The default is actionable.
    </p>
    <h3>Actionable</h3>
    <p>
        <i>Single action or Project?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you first think about the thought and enter the successful outcome for this
        activity. The display of the successful outcome field is configurable (see
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.action/tr/view/action/docs/actions-prefs.html">Actions Preferences</a>).
        It is then easier to decide:
        <ul>

            <li>
                whether it will take more than one action to achieve this result (and therefore require
                a project), or if one single action will achieve the thought;
            </li>
            <li>
                if the thought is related to an existing project or sub-project.
            </li>
        </ul>
        If a new project is required, you can create the project as a top project or as belonging to an
        existing project or sub-project.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must enter the description of the next physical action that should be done. The description
        is defaulted to the thought description but it can be overwritten.
    </p>

    <p>
        A context for this action can also be selected. You can also enter notes for that action. The
        display of the following fields is configurable:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Due Date and Start Date: see <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.action/tr/view/action/docs/actions-prefs.html">Actions Preferences</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Priority, Time, Energy: see <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.criteria/tr/view/criteria/docs/criteria.html">Criteria</a>
            </li>


        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Action Status</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        You now have five choices for this action as follows.
        <ol>
            <li>

                If the action will take less than two minutes to do, you should do it
                straight away and then check the done check box;
            </li>
            <li>
                If the action should not be done yet but you wish to record it, then select the
                &quot;Inactive&quot; Status. The Start date can be entered. When the Start date is
                reached or has passed (in case you don&#39;t run the application for a few days),
                the action will become a &quot;Do ASAP&quot; one automatically;
            </li>
            <li>

                If the action should be done as soon as possible, then select the &quot;Do ASAP&quot; Status;
            </li>
            <li>
                If the action only occurs at a particular date and time, select the &quot;Scheduled&quot;
                Status.  Then click the button along side to select a date, then enter the time (24 hours
                format: 7 o'clock in the evening should be entered as 19:00) and duration if applicable. You
                can also create a <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.actions/tr/view/actions/docs/recurrence.html">recurrence</a>
                definition;
            </li>
            <li>
                If you wish to delegate the action to someone else, select the &quot;Delegated&quot; Status
                and enter who you are delegating to (an email address or name) and a date to &quot;Follow-up&quot;
                whether it has been done.  To inform the person you are delegating to, you can send an email by
                pressing the &quot;Email&quot; button. Delegate To is copied as addressee, Action Description as
                subject and Notes as email text.
                <p>
                    There are two user options for this delegation emailing in <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.action/tr/view/action/docs/actions-prefs.html">Actions Preferences</a>
                as follows:</p>
                <p>- you can opt to append the text &quot;Email sent&quot; followed by the current date, to the end of the notes field.</p>
                <p>- you can change the character encoding. You may need to do this if your particular email client program does not
                properly accept the details passed to it.</p>
                <p>
                    Please note that to use the email functionality on Linux, a proper email address (containing a
                    &quot;@&quot;) needs to be entered.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Project</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on your decisions at the beginning, check the project check box if a new project is required. A new project will be created automatically.
        The project description is defaulted to the thought description but it can be overwritten.  If
        the action does not have a thought, or if you leave the project name blank, the action description will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the thought is related to an existing project (current or future), press the button. A pop-up window opens with two tabs: Projects and Future Projects.
        From the appropriate tree, select the project (or sub-project) the action (and possibly the new project) belongs to. In the tree, a project can be expanded
        or not and you can change the order to alphabetic using the buttons above the project tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Notes field transfer</i>

    </p>
    <p>
        If Notes were entered for the thought, they will be copied into the action&#39;s notes and to the project&#39;s notes
        (if applicable).
    </p>
    <i>Priority field</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        An action created under an existing project will take the priority of that project, unless the user has entered a
        priority for that action. A sub-project created under an existing project will take the priority of that project.
    </p>

    <h3>Not actionable</h3>
    <p>
    If the thought is not actionable, you can do one of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            decide you don&#39;t need to do anything for that thought and delete it;
        </li>
        <li>
            keep it for later (Someday/Maybe Items). A tickle date can be entered to get reminded about the Someday/Maybe Item.
            When the tickle date is reached or has passed (in case you don&#39;t run the application for a few days),
            the Someday/Maybe Item will be sent back to your unprocessed thoughts box and will re-appear at the top of
            unprocessed thoughts the next time you call the Process Thoughts screen;
        </li>

        <li>
            keep it as reference (Reference Items).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Others</h3>

    <p>
        Lastly you press the <i>Process Thought</i> button or its
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.model/tr/model/docs/shortcuts.html">Shortcut Key</a>

        The next thought is then displayed at the top and the entry fields are reset.
    </p>
    <p>
        For &#39;tickled&#39; Someday/Maybe items, the word &#39;Tickled&#39; + tickle date will be appended at the
        beginning of the thought description.
    </p>

    <p>
        For any date selection: the calendar window &quot;Select Date&quot; will open, allowing you to Select a
        date, Clear it or Cancel. You can select a date by double-clicking on it. You can also enter the date directly. You
        can set the date format and what is the first day of your week (Sunday or Monday):
        see <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.action/tr/view/action/docs/actions-prefs.html">Dates</a>.
    </p>
