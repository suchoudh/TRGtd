        <h2>Calendar Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            In this category there is an option to publish data to an iCalendar format file.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this option is selected the path for the file can be entered. This can be 
            either:
        </p>
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr><td><b>a file</b></td><td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The selected file is used as the 
            output file.</i></td></tr>	
            <tr><td><b>a folder</b></td><td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The output file will be put in 
                        the selected folder and have the same name as the data file but with .ics 
            extension.</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>blank</b></td><td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The output file will be put in the 
                        same folder and have the same name as the data file but with the .ics extension.
            </i></td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The iCalendar file is output every time the datafile is saved (at least every 30 
            seconds). It will be populated with Do Asap actions as To Do items, Delegated 
            Actions with a follow-up date as All Day Events and Scheduled Actions as
            Specific Date and Time Events.
        </p>
        <p>
           The user can also specify a Time zone which is used for the iCalendar file.
        </p>
