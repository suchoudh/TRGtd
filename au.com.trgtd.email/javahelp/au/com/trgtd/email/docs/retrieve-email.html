        <h2>Retrieve Email</h2>
        <p>
            This function retrieves emails from the email account you have set-up under            
            <a href="email-prefs.html">Email Preferences</a> and imports them into TR. Each email becomes a thought, with 
            the description set to the subject of the email and the notes set to the body of the email. The emails
            are deleted from the mail server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that this function does NOT work if you have a proxy server. This is a restriction due 
            to JavaMail.
