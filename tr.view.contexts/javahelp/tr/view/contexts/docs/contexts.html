        <h2>Contexts Screen</h2>
        <p> 
            A context should describe where or how an action could be done. Examples 
            of contexts are: Phone calls, At Computer, At the Shops, On-line, At Home, 
            Errands.  Contexts are useful for deciding what you can do next, as this 
            often depends on where you are and what tools you have available. Contexts 
            are also used in reports, so you can have with you all the actions which 
            need doing while you are in different situations - at the mall, for example.
        </p> 
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            The data in this screen is displayed in a table. To navigate between 
            rows, you can use the mouse or the arrows keys. 
        </p>
        <h3>Contexts Order</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;None&quot; is always on the top of the list and cannot be updated or deleted;
            </li>
            <li>
                You can sort the contexts by clicking once on the header of the column you wish to sort by. To order on more than one column,
                 click once on the other column(s). To select a new first column for the ordering, <b>double-click</b> on that column;             
            </li> 
            <li>
                Each mouse click on a column changes the sort order and cycles through ascending/descending alphabetical 
                sort order.
            </li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Add Context</h3>
        <p> 
            Enter a new context using the <i>Add Context</i> button. The description does not have 
            to be entered.  It is only displayed on the Contexts screen.  
        </p> 
        <h3>Context modification</h3>
        <p>
            To modify, navigate to the appropriate context and either use the <i>Edit Context</i> button, or press Enter or double click.  
            The Edit Context window opens and data can be corrected. Press the OK button to save your change and 
            go back to the list. Press the Esc key or the CANCEL button to close the window and ignore any changes. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            You can delete a context by using the <i>Delete Context</i> button or the 
            Delete key. No confirmation is required. If the context has
            been associated to data, a dialog box opens to let you choose with which 
            context you would like to replace the one you are deleting.
