        <h2>Recurrence Task</h2>
        <p>
            The recurrence task generates next recurrent actions for every scheduled action with recurrence
            based on a start date, according to the recurrence specified for the action.            
        </p>

            The recurrence task is run 2 munutes after every startup, or when a data file is opened,
            and then every 2 minutes after midnight (while TR is running).
