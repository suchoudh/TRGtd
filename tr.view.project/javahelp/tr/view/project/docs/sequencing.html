        <h2>Automatic Sequencing</h2>
        <p>
            Within a project, in order to get an action set from Inactive to Do ASAP automatically when the previous Do ASAP action is set to 
            done, you need to set the sequencing on at the project level. If the sequencing fields do not appear on 
            the project details panel, please check your 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.prefs.projects/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two methods for automatic sequencing:
            <ul>
                <li>Exclude sub-projects: the sequence ignores any sub-projects;</li>
                <li>Include sub-projects (default one): the sequencing will go into a sub-project to select the next action when the 
                    action before the sub-project is set to done. For example: a user has a project with several actions that are sequenced and then a certain 
                    action needs to be broken down into sub-tasks so the user converts the action to a sub-project. When the last action BEFORE the sub-project 
                    is done, it will sequence INTO the sub-project. Similarly when the last action of a sub-project is set to done, it sequences onto the next higher 
                level action or even into the next sub-project if it sits in sequence.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>        
        <p>
            When creating a sub-project, the sequencing method of the project is used by default.
