 * @param {String} eventType of type DOMString The eventType parameter specifies the type of Event interface to
 * be created. If the Event interface
 * specified is supported by the implementation this method will
 * return a new Event of the
 * interface type requested. If the Event is to be
 * dispatched via the dispatchEvent method the
 * appropriate event init method must be called after creation in
 * order to initialize the Event 's values. As
 * an example, a user wishing to synthesize some kind of UIEvent would
 * call createEvent with the parameter "UIEvents". The initUIEvent method could then be called on the newly
 * created UIEvent to set
 * the specific type of UIEvent to be dispatched and set its context
 * information. The createEvent method is used in creating Event s when it is
 * either inconvenient or unnecessary for the user to create an Event themselves.
 * In cases where the implementation provided Event is
 * insufficient, users may supply their own Event implementations for use with the dispatchEvent method.
 * @return Event The newly created Event
