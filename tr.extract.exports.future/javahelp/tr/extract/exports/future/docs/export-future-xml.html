        <h2>Export Someday/Maybe Items (XML)</h2>
        <p>
            You can export Someday/Maybe Items to an XML file.  You can choose to include the Topic, the Notes and 
            the Tickle Date or not.  
        </p>
        <h3>Set-up</h3>
        <p>
            You can specify the output folder and the character encoding (e.g. UTF-8) of the exported file under 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.extract/tr/extract/docs/prefs-extract.html">Exports and Reports Preferences</a>.
        </p> 
        </p>
        <h3>Parameters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Include Topic?: if checked, topics are included;
            </li>
             <li>
                Include Notes?: if checked, notes are included;
            </li>
             <li>

            </li>

            <li>
                Field separator: you can select Tab, Comma or Semicolon;
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember these options: if checked, the parameters for this export are saved until the
                user changes them and saves them.
            </li>       
        </ul>        
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>
            The file is saved in the folder specified within the user preferences (see Set-up). 
            Current date and time are used to build the file name to make it unique. The output file is opened using 
            the default system application for XML files. 
        </p>
