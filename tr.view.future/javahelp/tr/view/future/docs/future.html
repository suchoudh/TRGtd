        <h2>Review Someday/Maybe Items</h2> 
        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>
            This screen is where you review the thoughts you might like to do one day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screen is divided horizontally into two parts. The top part contains the items as per your 
            selection (see filters). When an item is selected, the bottom part will display the details of the
            item.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Please note that all settings are kept when you exit the application, including the position of the 
            panels separation bars.
        <p>
        <h3>Columns</h3>

        <p>
            You can decide which fields to display or not as a column in the table part. Click the button on top of the table
            navigation bar on the right and check or unchecked the fields in the window accordingly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By changing the layout on the screen, you can change:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the column order;
                </li>
                <li>

                    the column width.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>            
            The following filters are present: Created From, Created To, Topic selection and a Search facility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When there is more than one filter, data relevant for all filters is displayed (corresponding to logical 
            AND operation).
        </p>

        <p>
            The Search filter allows you to enter a text. Once you press the Enter key, all items which have the text 
            in their notes or description are listed.<br> 
            For the Topic filter All, Multiple values or a specific value can be selected. <br>            
            The dates filters let you choose how far in the future or the past you want to review. 
        </p>
        <h3>Show Filters line</h3>
        <p>            
            You can show the filters line or not. Click the Show/Hide Filters button (first from the left) to toggle ON/OFF the 
            display. By default, the setting is to show the line.
        </p> 
        <h3>Table Order</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                You can sort the items by clicking once on the header of the column you wish to sort by. To order on more than one column,
                 click once on the other column(s). To select a new first column for the ordering, <b>double-click</b> on that column;             
            </li> 
            <li>
                Each mouse click on a column changes the sort order and cycles through ascending/descending alphabetical 
                sort order.
            </li> 
            <li>
                The Tickle Date is ordered as follows: first, date <= today, then null, then date > today.
            </li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Table Operations</h3>
        The following operations can be performed on the table:       
        <ul> 
            <li>
                Navigate: to navigate between rows, you can use the mouse or the arrows keys;
            </li>
            <li>
                Edit (Enter key): move focus to the detail panel to update the item. The cursor is positioned at the end of 
                the item description.
            </li> 
        </ul>         
        <h3>Operations</h3> 
        <p>

            To perform operations, you need to select the item in the Someday/Maybe Items Table and use the appropriate 
            button for the operation.             
        </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>
                Delete: delete the item. Confirmation is required. You can also press the Delete key once the item is selected;
            </li> 
            <li>
                Edit Item: allow update of the Item. You can also press the Enter key once the item is selected;
            </li> 
            <li>
                Reprocess: you might decide that now is the time to start on a Someday/Maybe Item. The application will navigate to the 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.process/tr/view/process/docs/process.html">Process Thoughts</a>                
                screen with the initial thought for that Someday/Maybe Item 
                displayed, allowing you to enter the next physical action for that thought. If you go back to the Someday/Maybe Items screen, 
                the item will not be displayed anymore as it has been actioned now.
            </li>  
        </ul>

        <p>
            A Someday/Maybe item starts with a thought so you can not add Someday/Maybe items using this screen. Use the 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.collect/tr/view/collect/docs/collect.html">Collect Thoughts</a>
            screen for new Someday/Maybe items.            
        </p>
        <h3>Notes field</h3> 
        <p>
            The operations you can do are described below in the order of the buttons from left to right. When insertion occurs, it happens at 
            the cursor position. Copy/Cut and paste of text can be done through the standard shortcut keys Command+C, Command+V and Command+P.
            <ul> 
                <li>

                    You need to click on the pencil symbol button or double-click on the field, in order to start the 
                    Edit mode before you can update the field;
                </li> 
                <li>
                    You can insert a website address by typing it directly or using the web symbol button;
                </li> 
                <li>
                    You can insert a file reference using the folder symbol button;
                </li> 
                <li>
                    You can insert today's date using the calendar symbol button. You can also use the shortcut key Ctrl+Alt+D;
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Tickle date</h3> 
        <p>
            You can use the tickle date to get reminded about the Someday/Maybe Item. When the tickle date is reached or 
            has passed (in case you don&#39;t run the application for a few days), the Someday/Maybe Item will be sent 
            back to your unprocessed thoughts box and will re-appear at the top of unprocessed thoughts the next 
            time you call the Process Thoughts screen.
