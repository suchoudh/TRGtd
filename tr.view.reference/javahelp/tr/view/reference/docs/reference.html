        <h2>Review Reference Items</h2> 
        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>
            This screen is where you review the references you have kept.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screen is divided horizontally into two parts. The top part contains the items as per your 
            selection (see filters). When an item is selected, the bottom part will display the details of the
            item.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Please note that all settings are kept when you exit the application, including the position of the 
            panels separation bars.
        <p>
        <h3>Columns</h3>

        <p>
            You can decide which fields to display or not as a column in the table part. Click the button on top of the table
            navigation bar on the right and check or unchecked the fields in the window accordingly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By changing the layout on the screen, you can change:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the column order;
                </li>
                <li>

                    the column width.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>            
            The following filters are present: Created From, Created To, Topic selection and a Search facility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When there is more than one filter, data relevant for all filters is displayed (corresponding to logical 
            AND operation).
        </p>

        <p>
            The Search filter allows you to enter a text. Once you press the Enter key, all items which have the text 
            in their notes or description are listed.<br> 
            For the Topic filter All, Multiple values or a specific value can be selected. <br>            
            The dates filters let you choose how far in the future or the past you want to review. 
        </p>
        <h3>Show Filters line</h3>
        <p>            
            You can show the filters line or not. Click the Show/Hide Filters button (first from the left) to toggle ON/OFF the 
            display. By default, the setting is to show the line.

        <h3>Table Order</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                You can sort the items by clicking once on the header of the column you wish to sort by. To order on more than one column,
                 click once on the other column(s). To select a new first column for the ordering, <b>double-click</b> on that column;             
            </li> 
            <li>
                Each mouse click on a column changes the sort order and cycles through ascending/descending alphabetical 
                sort order.
            </li>             
        </ul>
        <h3>Table Operations</h3>

        The following operations can be performed on the table:

            </li>
            <li>
                Edit (Enter key): move focus to the detail panel to update the item. The cursor is positioned at the end of 
                the item description.
            </li> 
        </ul>         
        <h3>Operations</h3> 
        <p>
            To perform operations, you need to select the item in the Reference Items Table and use the appropriate 
            button for the operation.             
        </p>

        <ul> 
            <li>

            </li> 
            <li>
                Reprocess: you might decide that the initial thought should have been actioned instead 
                of being stored as reference. The application will navigate to the 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.process/tr/view/process/docs/process.html">Process Thoughts</a>                
                screen with the initial thought for that Reference Item displayed, allowing you to 
                enter the next physical action for that thought. If you go back to the Reference 
                Items screen, the item will not be displayed anymore as it has been actioned now.
            </li>  
        </ul>

        <p>
            A Reference item starts with a thought so you can not add Reference items using this screen. Use the 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.collect/tr/view/collect/docs/collect.html">Collect Thoughts</a>
            screen for new Reference   	 items.            
        </p>
