    <h2>Review Projects</h2>
    
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        This screen is where you plan and review your projects. The screen is divided vertically 
        into two parts. The left part is the project tree (explorer) and the right part displays 
        the details of either a project/sub-project or an action depending on what is selected 
        on the tree. When expanded the project tree shows sub-projects and actions under each 
        project. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the tree explorer, there are 4 tabs:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Projects: contains all your current projects;
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Single Actions: contains all your single actions, i.e. actions not part of a project;
            </li>                
            <li>
                Future: contains <b>projects</b> that got delayed, put on the side for a while or
                for which you decided to start the planning process in advance. It should not be 
                confused with Someday/Maybe Items which are just thoughts you might do one day. When the 
                project becomes current, you can cut and paste it to the Projects tab. You can 
                also use the Start date to get the project moved automatically to the Projects 
                tab (see below under Projects Operations, Edit);
            </li>
            <li>
                Templates: contains project structures you want to re-use like 'Start Marketing 
                Campaign for product X', 'Reply Offer To Tender Client Y', etc. To use a template
                for a new project, just copy and paste it into the Projects Tab and update 
                descriptions accordingly.
            </li>
            
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>
        To navigate in the project tree, you can use the mouse or the up and down arrows keys. To 
        navigate in the detail part, you can use the mouse or the Tab, Shift+Tab keys. To navigate between the 2 
        parts, you can use the F5 key or the mouse.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Tree</h3>
    <p>
        
        <b><i>Order</i></b><br>
        Initially the projects, sub-projects and actions are sorted in the order they were entered. You can change that order by:
        <ul>
            <li>
                selecting the projects, sub-projects or actions and move them up and down using the Move operation;
            </li>
            <li>
                using the drag and drop functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>            
        <b><i>Drag and Drop functionality</i></b><br>
        
        To move sub-projects and actions to a different project, you can drag and drop them using the mouse. You can also change a 
        sub-project to be a stand alone project by dragging it under the All projects node. Similarly, you can drag a project under 
        another project, changing it to a sub-project. If you drag a project or sub-project, all subtasks are moved too.
    </p>   
    <h3>Add Action and Add Project</h3>     
    <p>
        Add Action and Add Project operations work from anywhere in the 2 parts. The action or project will be added within the 
        project the action or project previously selected is. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An action created under an existing project will take the priority of that project. 
        A sub-project created under an existing project will take the priority of that project.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Operations</h3>
    <p>
        To perform all operations except Add Action and Add Project, you need to select the project node and either use the right-click menu or the 
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.model/tr/model/docs/shortcuts.html">Shortcut Key</a>
        
        assigned to the operation. You can also use the Add Action, Add Project or Show/Hide Done buttons.
    </p>        
    <p>
        Except for Edit, Add action and Add project, all other operations can be performed to more than one project at the time. Just hold 
        the Shift or Command key while selecting them.
    </p>
    <b><i>Edit</i></b><br>
    <p>
        Once you have selected a project, sub-project or action on the tree part, you can move to its description 
        by using the Edit menu option or the Enter key. The cursor is then positioned at the end of the 
        description. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        The display of the following fields is configurable: 
        <ul>
            
            <li>
                Project sequencing, Due Date and Start Date: see 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.prefs.projects/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>                
            </li>            
            <li>
                Priority, Time, Energy: see 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.criteria/tr/view/criteria/docs/criteria.html">Criteria</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>    
    The following operations are possible:
    <ul>                
        <li>
            
            modify its description;
        </li>
        <li>
            change its topic: when subtasks are created, the project topic is the default but can be overwritten;
        </li>
        <li>
            maintain its priority;
        </li>
        <li>
            plan the project/sub-project;
        </li>
        
        <li>
            maintain Notes;
        </li>              
        <li>
            set up the sequencing method 
            (see <a href="nbdocs://tr.prefs.projects/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>). 
            Please note that when a sub-project is created, its default method for sequencing is the 
            project&#39;s one;
        </li>
        <li>
            maintain the Created Date if required. This needs to be enabled, see 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.prefs.projects/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>;
        </li>                
        <li>
            
            enter a Start date. For future project, when the Start date is reached or has passed (in case 
            you don&#39;t run the application for a few days), the future project will be moved automatically
            to the Projects tab.
        </li>                
        <li>
            enter a Due Date if appropriate;
        </li>
        <li>
            set it to done: an error message is displayed if all the subtasks are not set to done themselves. 
            You can select the Done date if it is not today;
        </li>
        <li>
            reset it to not done. If you are resetting a sub-project within a done project, the project is 
            automatically reset to not done.
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Expand All/Collapse All: tree expansion</i></b><br>
        The project/sub-project expands and the subtasks are listed under the project/sub-project. You can expand
        all projects by selecting the top node &quot;Projects&quot;. To perform the same operation, you can also 
        click on the expansion symbol on the left of the project node.
    </p>
    <b><i>Show Done/Hide Done</i></b><br>
    
    
    When you perform the Show Done operation, done actions and done sub-projets for the selected node are shown as well
    as the undone ones. Perform Hide Done to only see the ones to be done.
    <p>
        <b><i>Add action</i></b><br>
        This operation adds an inactive action under the selected subtask. You can change the default 
        status of that action under 
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.prefs.projects/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>. 
        The whole action description is selected to allow you to type directly the action description.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Add project</i></b><br>
        This operation adds a sub-project under the selected subtask. The whole 
        project description is selected to allow you to type directly the project description.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b><i>Copy, Cut and Paste functionality</i></b><br>
        You can copy, cut and paste projects (and their actions) to a different project. You can also change a 
        sub-project to be a stand alone project by cutting and pasting it under the Projects node. Similarly, 
        you can cut and paste a project under another project, changing it to a sub-project. If you copy/cut and
        paste a project or sub-project, all subtasks are copied/moved too. These operations can be done between 
        Tabs too.
    </p>
    <p>            
        <b><i>Move project</i></b><br>
        You can move a project or sub-project by selecting it and using this operation to move it up or down 
        within the project it is in.
    </p>
    <a name="export-template"/>
    <p>            
        <b><i>Export Template</i></b><br>
        This function exports the selected project or sub-project into a separate file. 
        You can then share this file with other TR users, within your team or with the 
        TR community through the TR website. A file with the extension .trpt is created. This is 
        the file the other users will need to import using the Import Project Template function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Others</i></b><br>
        Change Topic: combo is displayed to select the new topic. <br>
        Delete: you can delete a project or sub-project. A confirmation is required.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plan">Planning</h3>
    To plan the project/sub-project, there are five recommended steps:
    <ol>
        <li>
            
            Enter the purpose: this is the &quot;why&quot; you are doing this project/sub-project. By defining
            it, it will:             
            <ul>
                <li>
                    create decision-making criteria;
                </li>
                <li>
                    motivate;
                </li>
                <li>
                    clarify your focus;
                </li>
                <li>
                    expand options by getting you into creative thinking.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to visualise the results: view the project/sub-project beyond the completion date (capture 
            features, aspects, qualities you imagine in place);
        </li>            
        <li>Brainstorming: just write all the ideas that come into your mind about this
            project/sub-project, you will analyse them and organise them later. In addition to 
            capturing your original ideas, by brainstorming you will also have many new 
            ideas. Don&#39;t ignore any idea, they might prove interesting or useful later 
            on when you are developing your options. Also you will be more confident 
            about your choices;
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Organising: a natural organisation will probably emerge during the 
            brainstorming step. You need to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    identify the key steps;
                </li>
                <li>
                    sort them out by component, sequences and priorities;
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    detailed them to the right level.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>            
        <li>
            Next actions: during this step, you will create the actions or sub-projects 
            required for this project/sub-project. You can either just enter the next subtask to get the 
            project/sub-project starting or continuing, or enter as many next subtasks you can think of at the moment about this 
            project/sub-project and decide which ones are active (i.e. to be done currently).
        </li>
        <p>
            Please note that there are no limits to sub-project nesting, i.e. a sub-project can include sub-projects, 
            etc. but it is recommended not to use more than a few levels.
        </p>
    </ol>
    
    <a name="action-operations"/>    
    <h3>Action Operations</h3>
    <p>
        To perform operations, you need to select the action node and either use the right-click menu or the 
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.model/tr/model/docs/shortcuts.html">Shortcut Key</a>
        assigned to the operation. You can also use the Add Action, Add Project, Reprocess or Convert to Project buttons.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Except for Edit, all other operations can be performed to more than one 
        action at the time. Just hold the Shift or Command key while selecting them.
    </p>        
    <b><i>Edit</i></b><br>
    
    <p>
        
        An action can be edited by selecting it from the project tree once the 
        project/sub-project has been expanded. You can then:
        <ul>
            <li>
                maintain its description;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its topic, default to the project&#39;s topic;
            </li>
            <li>
                
                maintain its context;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its priority, time or energy;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its status (which type of action is it: Do ASAP, Delegated, Scheduled, or Inactive);
            </li>
            <li>
                for scheduled actions only, you can enter                 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.actions/tr/view/actions/docs/recurrence.html">Recurrence</a> definition;
            </li>                
            <li>
                
                add notes to it: this notes field is useful for storing an agenda (if action is Prepare Meeting), a list of 
                questions (if action is Call Builder), for storing a list (if action is Get Christmas presents), etc;
            </li> 
            <li>
                maintain the Created Date if required. This needs to be enabled, see 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.action/tr/view/action/docs/actions-prefs.html">Actions Preferences</a>;
            </li> 
            <li>
                set it to done: the done date is automatically set to today&#39;s date but can be modified;
            </li>
            <li>
                reset it to not done. If the action was within a done project/sub-project, the project/sub-project is automatically 
                reset to not done; 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                enter a start date if appropriate;
            </li>
            <li>
                enter a due date if appropriate.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Convert to project</i></b><br>		
        Use this operation if you decide that this action should be decomposed into more than one action. A project (if single action) or
        a sub-project is then created automatically with the original action&#39;s description as the project/sub-project&#39;s description. 
        The action&#39;s notes, topic, priority and due date are also copied to the project/sub-project. The original action is the first action of 
        the project/sub-project.          
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b><i>Reprocess</i></b><br>	
        The action will be sent back to the top of the unprocessed thoughts. If you select Reprocess Now, the application will navigate to the 
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.process/tr/view/process/docs/process.html">Process Thoughts</a>
        screen with the initial thought for that action displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Copy and Cut functionality</i></b><br>
        You can copy, cut and paste actions to a different project. These operations can be done between Tabs too. When you copy an action, the 
        original thought is not copied across to the new action. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b><i>Add action</i></b><br>
        This operation adds an inactive action under the selected subtask. You can change the default 
        status of that action under 
        <a href="nbdocs://tr.prefs.projects/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>. 
        The whole action description is selected to allow you to type directly the action description.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Add project</i></b><br>
        This operation adds a sub-project under the selected subtask. The whole 
        project description is selected to allow you to type directly the project description.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Set Done</i></b><br>    
        This function sets the action to done. It is very useful if you want to set multiple actions to done.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Postpone Action Date</i></b><br>
        This function increases the action date by the number of periods specified:
        <ul>
            <li>if action is Inactive, the start date is postponed;</li>
            <li>if action is Do ASAP, the due date is postponed;</li>
            <li>if action is Scheduled, the scheduled date is postponed;</li>
            <li>if action is Delegated, the follow-up date is postponed.</li>
        </ul>
        If the action did not have an action date, the action date is calculated as the current date plus the postponement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><i>Move action</i></b><br>
        
        You can move an action by selecting it and using this operation to move it up or down within the project it is in.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b><i>Others</i></b><br>
        Change Topic: combo is displayed to select the new topic. <br>
        Change Context: combo is displayed to select the new context. <br>
        
        Delete: you can delete an action. A confirmation is required.
    </p>
    <h3>Notes field</h3> 
    <p>
        The possible operations are described below in the order of the buttons from left to right. When insertion occurs, it happens at 
        the cursor position. Copy/Cut and paste of text can be done through the standard shortcut keys Command+C, Command+V and Command+P.
        <ul> 
            <li>
                You need to click on the pencil symbol button or double-click on the field, in order to start the 
                Edit mode before you can update the field;
            </li> 
            <li>
