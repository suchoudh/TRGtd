        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <p>
            The topics are used to classify your thoughts and are kept as the thoughts 
            become an item, an action or a project. Examples of topics are: Personal,             
            Financial, Health, House, Work, Kids, Book, CDs.
        </p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            The data in this screen is displayed in a table. To navigate between 
            rows, you can use the mouse or the arrows keys. 
        </p>
        <h3>Topics Order</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;None&quot; is always on the top of the list and cannot be updated or deleted;
            </li>
            <li>
                You can sort the topics by clicking once on the header of the column you wish to sort by. To order on more than one column,
                 click once on the other column(s). To select a new first column for the ordering, <b>double-click</b> on that column;             
            </li> 
            <li>
                Each mouse click on a column changes the sort order and cycles through ascending/descending alphabetical 
                sort order.
            </li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Add Topic</h3>
        <p> 
            Enter a new topic using the <i>Add Topic</i> button. The description does not have 
            to be entered.  It is only displayed on the Topics screen. The colours you choose 
            will be the display text colour and background colour for all thoughts, 
            projects, actions and items within that topic on all review screens. Avoid 
            using red and grey as these colours have special meaning. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Topic modification</h3>
        <p>
            To modify, navigate to the appropriate topic and either use the <i>Edit Topic</i> button, or press Enter or double click.  
            The Edit Topic window opens and data can be corrected. Press the OK button to save your change and 
            go back to the list. Press the Esc key or the CANCEL button to close the window and ignore any changes. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            You can delete a topic by using the <i>Delete Topic</i> button or the 
            Delete key. No confirmation is required. If the topic has
            been associated to data, a dialog box opens to let you choose with which 
            topic you would like to replace the one you are deleting.
