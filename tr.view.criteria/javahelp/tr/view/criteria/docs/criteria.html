        <h2>Criteria</h2>
        <p>
            Time, Energy and Priority are other criteria you can use when you review 
            your actions and decide which one to do next. These fields are optional: you 
            need to select the criterion in the combo box and check the "Use this criterion" 
            check box to get the criterion displayed when you enter your action data.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each criterion, the existing values are there to help you understand the 
            purpose of the criterion. You can then:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    click on the value: update description to be more meaningful to you;
                </li>
                <li>
                    click on the plus symbol button: add some new values;
                </li>
                <li>
                    click on the minus symbol button: delete some values;
                </li>                
                <li>
                    use the arrows keys buttons: change the order. This order is used 
                    in the combo showing the values, when ordering actions in Review Actions screen
                    and in reports.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            For the priority criteria you can specify a mapping to the iCalendar priority values. iCalendar
            applications treat the numeric values differently so you may need to find out which values to
            set for use with your preferred calendar application.  As an example iCal on Mac uses the following
            values: 1 to 4 means High, 5 means Medium and 6 to 9 means Low.
            </p>
        </p>
        These values are saved with the data so if you open a new data file, only the values as per installation 
        will be present.
