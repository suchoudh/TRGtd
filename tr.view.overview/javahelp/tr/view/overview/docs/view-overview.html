        <h2>Overview Screen</h2>
        <p>
            The Overview Screen shows a diagram of the ThinkingRock (TR) screens corresponding to the 
            Getting Things Done (GTD) workflow.  You can click on any of the boxes representing a TR 
            screen to go to that screen.
        </p>
        <h4>Create Data File</h4>
        Initially only the Create Data File box is enabled as you first need to create a data file. 
        Click on this box and choose a file name and location for your TR data file.
        
        <h4>Setup</h4>        
        <p>
            You will need to set up some 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.contexts/tr/view/contexts/docs/contexts.html">Contexts</a> and
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.topics/tr/view/topics/docs/topics.html">Topics</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need to decide if you want to use the following criteria to review your work: 
            Priority, Time, Energy (see 
                <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.criteria/tr/view/criteria/docs/criteria.html">Criteria</a>).    
        </p>
        <p>
            We also recommend you go through all the preferences to specify output folders and various settings.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Collect</h4>                
        <p>
            Use the 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.collect/tr/view/collect/docs/collect.html">Collect 
            Thoughts</a> screen regularly to make sure of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>everything gets into your trusted system and will eventually be dealt with;</li>
                <li>your brain and memory are free to be creative and productive.</li> 
            </ul>
        </p>
            
        <h4>Process</h4>        
        <p>            
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.process/tr/view/process/docs/process.html">Process 
            Thoughts</a> into:
            <ul>
                <li>things you will never do, you might as well delete;</li>
                <li>things you might do one day (Someday/Maybe Items);</li>
                <li>reference (Reference Items);</li>
                <li>the next physical actions required (Actions.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        Actions consist of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>ones you can delegate (Delegated Actions);</li>
            <li>ones you have to do by or on a certain date (Scheduled Actions);</li>
            <li>ones that just have to be done as soon as possible (Do ASAP Actions).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Whenever a thought requires more than one physical action to be fulfilled, you 
            can create a Project. This will allow you to group Actions and perform 
            them in the sequence required. When you review your projects, you will be able 
            to plan and organise them.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a thought is related to an existing project or sub-project, you can add the 
            new action to it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Processing any thought should only take a few seconds: you are only deciding 
            what should be done with the thought, not acting on it. Once a thought is 
            processed it will not appeared anymore on the 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.collect/tr/view/collect/docs/collect.html">Collect 
            Thoughts</a> screen.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Organise, Review, Do</h4>                
        <p>
            Once the whole picture of your work is in front of you, you can start doing the 
            actions on your list according to your Context (where you are), the energy and 
            time you have available.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should review your information regularly: daily for actions and projects, 
            weekly for the Someday/Maybe items.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you first start using ThinkingRock, the three steps required to get from a 
            thought to an action into your &quot;Do ASAP actions&quot; list might seem 
            cumbersome but this tool is designed to encourage clear thinking. Going regularly 
            to the 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.collect/tr/view/collect/docs/collect.html">Collect 
            Thoughts</a> screen encourages you to enter all you other thoughts everytime and 
            not just the action which came to mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, when you plan your projects, we strongly recommend that you enter the 
            Purpose of the project, the Vision of the results, Brainstorming all ideas and 
            Organization of them. This information will help you to be more effective, 
            motivated, clear, productive and innovative. Being clear about why you are doing 
            a project and what you hope to achieve is the best way to make it a successful 
            and enjoyable challenge.
