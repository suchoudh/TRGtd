        <h2>Import Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            You can import a text file containing thoughts. A file dialog box allows you to select 
            the file to import. The last directory used will be remembered.   
        </p>
        <h3>Set-up</h3>
        <p>
            You can specify the character set to use when importing text file under 
            <a href="prefs-import-thoughts.html">Import Thoughts Preferences</a>. 
            If no entry then default system encoding is used.
        </p>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <p>
            Each thought should be on a separate line optionally followed by a tab and the topic name. 
            If the topic does not exist or is not recognised, the topic &quot;None&quot; is set.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the file is large (greater than approximately 50 lines) a confirmation message is displayed.
        </p>
