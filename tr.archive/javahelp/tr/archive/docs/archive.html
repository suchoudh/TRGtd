        <h2>Archive</h2>
        <p>The archive process first saves a backup copy of your data file and
        then removes from the data file, all single actions and projects 
        completed on or before a specified archive date. An archive file is 
        created containing the archived single actions and projects.
        </p>
        <p>The archive process is called from the File menu. &nbsp;You will need 
        to enter:
            <ul>
                <li>the Archive Folder in which the archive file should be saved: 
                we recommend you use a different folder to that of your data file;</li>
                <li>the Archive Date: the last archived date (if any) is 
                displayed;</li>
                <li>check box Archive Done projects only: if checked, the whole top level project needs to 
                have been completed by the archive date for actions to be archived. If unchecked, the 
                archiving is done on current projects or on projects completed after the archived date
                as long as the actions have been set to done before or on the archive date.</li>
        </p>
        <p>Press the Archive button to start the process. A message is displayed 
        when the process has finished.
        </p>        
        <p>The following is a detailed description of the archiving process:
            <ol>
                <li>First a backup copy of the current data file is made, named 
                {datafile-name}-{current-date}-{current-time}-backup.xml 
                (e.g. thinking-rock-20070514-205057123.backup.xml)</li>
                <li>A second copy of the current data file is made, named:
                {datafile-name}-{archive-date}-{current-time}-archive.xml &nbsp;From this copy, 
                the process removes:</li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>all single actions with no Done date or Done Date after 
                    the Archived Date;</li>
                    <li>all unprocessed thoughts, Someday/Maybe Items and Reference 
                    Items;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on done projects only: all top level Projects and 
                    associated sub-projects and actions where the Project&#39;s with no Done Date 
                    or Project&#39;s Completed Date after the Archived Date;</li> 
                    <li>if archiving on all projects: all actions with no Done Date 
                    or Done Date after the Archived Date. The project hierarchy is kept so 
                    you might have a project appearing in both the current and archived data files;</li>
                    <li>all projects under the Future Tab;</li>
                    <li>all projects under the Templates Tab.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>From the current data file, the application removes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>single actions with Done Date on or before the Archived Date;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on done projects only: all top Projects and associated 
                    sub-projects and actions where the Project Completed Date is on or before 
                    the Archive Date;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on all projects: all actions and sub-projects with Done Date or 
                    Completed Date on or before the Archived Date.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </p>        
        <p>
            <b>Notes</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Projects and actions under the Future Projects and Template 
                Projects Tab are never archived;</li>
                <li>Contexts, Topics and Criteria values are saved in the archived 
                file;</li>
                <li>You can review archived data by opening the data file using 
                ThinkingRock.</li>
