        <h2>Recurrence</h2>
        <p>This functionality is available for scheduled actions to automatically repeat an action periodically. 
        </p>
        <h3>Recurence generation</h3>
        <p>
            There are two types of recurrency: regular and subsequent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Regular</i><br> 
            When the recurrence information is entered, a number of actions are created using the frequency pattern and the start date.  
            If the start date is in the past, actions are created to catch up to today, then actions in the future are generated to reach
            the specified number of periods in advance (i.e. from today). The start date defaults to the scheduled date of the action. It 
            can be modified to a future date.<br>
            A background <a href="nbdocs://tr.background.recurrence/tr/background/recurrence/docs/tasks-recurrence.html">recurrence task</a>             
            runs periodically to check if new actions should be created. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            <i>Subsequent</i><br>
            The next action is only created when the current action is set to done. The frequency pattern is 
            used to calculate the new date from the <b>done date</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Frequency pattern fields definition</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>the frequency pattern: daily, weekdays, weekly, monthly or yearly and how many periods;</li>
            <li>for regular recurrency: for how many periods in the future should actions be created. A default value per 
            frequency (daily, weekdays, weekly, monthly or yearly) is set but can be changed under Preferences/Miscellaneous/Recurrence;</li>
            <li>ending options: never, after a number of periods, end date.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Note on the Start Date</h3>
        <p>
            The start date cannot be prior to the scheduled date of the action selected. If you need an earlier start date, you need to 
            update the scheduled date of the action prior to modify the recurrency.
        </p>
        <h3>Update Recurrency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>if you update one of the action in the action panel, the other actions in the series will not be affected;</li>
            <li>if you want to modify the recurrency actions details, press the Modify recurrency button, Change Action choice. The 
            actions in the series after the specified date will be modified;</li>
            <li>if you want to modify the recurrency pattern details, press the Modify recurrency button, Change Recurrence choice.
                The actions in the series after the specified date will be deleted and new actions following the updated pattern will 
            be created;</li>
            <li>if you want to change the project in which the actions are generated, press the Modify recurrency button, Change Project choice.
                The actions prior to the selected date will not be linked to the recurrency anymore. The actions on and after the selected date will
            be moved to the new project. Any action created afterwards will be in the new project.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Change Recurrence type</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>if you change from regular to subsequent, the actions prior to the selected date will not be linked to the recurrency anymore.
            The actions after the selected date will be deleted. The subsequent recurrency will be applied to the selected action;</li>
            <li>if you change from subsequent to regular, the application behaves as when you create a regular recurrency starting from the 
            specified date.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stop Recurrency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>to stop actions to be generated for a recurrency, press the Modify recurrency button, Change Recurrence choice and 
            either enter a maximum number of period (if you know it) or an end date;<\li>
            <li>to remove all recurrency information on the actions, press the Modify recurrency button, Remove Recurrence choice. This 
            stops the generation of new actions but does not delete the already created actions. This has to be done manually.</li>
        </ul>
