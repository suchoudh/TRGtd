        <h2>Actions Screens Preferences</h2>
        
        <p>
            The Actions Screens preferences allow you to specify the action tabs that will be shown when you 
            <a href="review-actions.html">review actions</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
        These settings will be saved in a separate file called ReviewAction.xml and can be shared between different platforms. 
        The file will be saved under the same folder as the data file. We recommend that you do a backup of that file in a different directory.
        <p>
            You can do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                    Rename an actions tab by selecting it and typing the new name;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a new actions tab by clicking on the plus symbol button;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove an actions tab by selecting a row and clicking on the minus symbol button;
                </li>                
                <li>
                    Change the order the actions tabs will appear by selecting a row and clicking the Up or Down arrow buttons.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that when you enter for the first time a name or update a name, you need to move out of the field to save the changes.
