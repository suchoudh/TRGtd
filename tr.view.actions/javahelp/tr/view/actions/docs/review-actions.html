        <h2>Review Actions</h2>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This feature is for reviewing your actions. It is composed of five pre-defined tabs: Actions, 
            Done, Do ASAP, Scheduled and Delegated. A counter indicates how many actions are selected within
            each tab. You can defined new Tabs or modified existing ones.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Each tab is divided horizontally into two parts. The top part contains the actions as per your 
            selection in a table. When an action is selected, the bottom part will display the details of the
            action (action panel) and the project (project tree panel) it is in (if any). The navigation and 
            functionality of the bottom half of the screen are the same as in the 
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.view.projects/tr/view/projects/docs/view-projects.html">Review Projects</a> screen. 
        </p>
        <p>            
            Please note that all settings are kept when you exit the application, including the position of the 
            panels separation bars (one setting for all tabs). All settings, except the bars position, will be saved in a separate file 
            called ReviewAction.xml and can be shared between different platforms. The file will be saved under the same 
            folder as the data file. We recommend that you do a backup of that file in a different directory.
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <h3>Tabs</h3>
            <p>                        
                You can maintain these tabs in the <a href="prefs-actions-screens.html">Action Screens preferences</a>:
                <ul>
                    <li>new Tabs can be created with user defined name. e.g. you could create a Today tab to only actions 
                        with the action date set to the current date), a Calls tab for all actions to be done using a Phone 
                    context, a Personal tab for all actions to be done belonging to personal topics;</li>
                    <li>
                        existing tabs can be renamed;
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        existing tabs can be removed;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        tabs order can be modified.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Toolbar</h3>
            <p>
                The buttons are described from left to right.
            </p>
            <b><i>Print Screen</i></b><br>
            <p>
                For each Tab, you can print the actions listed in the Tab. Click the Print Screen to PDF document button (first from the left). 
                On the report, the actions are listed in the same order as on the screen and the columns width is set proportionally as per screen. 
                The text is wrapped in each column. A symbol indicates the action status (see the legend in the report footer).
            </p>
            <p>    
                The following options can be set-up under Preferences/Options/Miscellaneous/Actions Screens:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        which font to use;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if you want the colour printed or not. The colour meaning will be the same as on the screen: topic colour and dates in red if past, 
                        blue if today and green if next week;
                    </li>    
                    <li>
                        
                        if you want to print done actions with strike out font or not.
                    </li>  
                </ul>     
            </p>
            <b><i>Columns</i></b><br>
            <p>
                For each Tab, you can decide which fields to display or not as a column in the table part. Click the Edit Columns 
                button (second from the left) and check or unchecked the fields in the Table Columns window accordingly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By changing the layout on the screen, you can change:
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>
                        the column order;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the column width.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The action date is set as follows: 
                <ul>
                    
                    <li> Do ASAP action: Due Date;</li>
                    <li> Inactive action: the earliest date between Start Date and Due Date;</li>
                    <li> Scheduled action: Scheduled Date;</li>
                    <li> Delegated action: the earliest date between Follow-Up Date and Due Date;</li>
                    <li> done actions: set to null.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <b><i>Filters</i></b><br>
            <p>            
                For each Tab, you can change the filtering. Click the Edit Fiters button (third from the left). The Selection 
                Filters window opens where you can: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use check box: set which filter to use or not;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        
                        Show check box: set if the filter should be displayed or not;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Values combo: set the initial value for the filter. If the filter is shown on the tab, the user 
                        can change this initial value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exclude if Null check box: if set, the actions with a null value in that field will not be listed. This setting is only 
                        available for the criteria and the dates fields. Please note that if you choose the value 'All' for the criteria fields
                        or don't select a date for the date fields, the actions with a null value will be included even if the box is checked.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When there is more than one filter, data relevant for all filters is displayed (corresponding to logical 
                AND operation).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Search filter allows you to enter a text. Once you press the Enter key, all actions which have the text 
                in their notes, description, immediate project description, or delegated to fields are listed.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the Status, Topic, Context or Criteria combos, All, Multiple values or a specific value can be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the Done filter, you can either show all actions or only the ones which have to be done or only the ones 
            which have been completed.</p>
            <p>
                The dates filters let you choose how far in the future or the past you want to review. 
            </p>
            
        </p>
        <b><i>Show Filters line</i></b><br>
        <p>            
            For each Tab, you can show the filters line or not. Click the Show/Hide Filters button (fourth from the left) to toggle ON/OFF the 
            display. By default, the setting is to show the line.
        </p> 
        <b><i>Action operations</i></b><br>
        <p>
            You can perform the following operations on actions selected on the list: Reprocess, Postpone, Change Context, Change Topic, 
            Set to Done and Delete. You need to select the action and press the toolbar button. The operations can be performed on more than one 
            actions at the time. Just hold the Shift or Command key while selecting them or use Command key+A to select all the actions on the list
