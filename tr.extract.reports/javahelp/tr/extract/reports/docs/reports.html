        <h2>Reports (Jasper)</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The reports can be divided into three types: action reports, project reports and item reports. 
            The action reports are for taking with you to do tasks and to review your short term work. 
            The project reports are for reviewing and planning your work.  Item reports show your someday/maybe
            list and your referenced information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reports are produced using JasperReports and can be saved in many 
            formats, including PDF. All reports use the DejaVu serif font. This font and its size 
            cannot be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most reports can be found under the Reports menu. In addition, the Project Outline, 
            Project Detail and Action Detail reports can be run from the popup menu (using the right mouse button 
            or control-key and mouse click) on any project or action in the project tree views.
        </p>
        <h3>Common parameters</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>Actions Reports</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Actions: Do ASAP</b>: this report lists all Do ASAP actions grouped by context.
            Contexts are listed alphabetically and actions are 
            ordered alphabetically within context. You can change the order within context to be by 
            priority, energy or time. You can also select a specific context;</li>
            <li><b>Actions: Delegated</b>: this report lists all Delegated actions within a specified 
            period, optionally grouped by Delegate. The order is by ascending Follow-up date;</li>
            <li><b>Actions: Scheduled</b>: this report lists all Scheduled actions within a specified

            <li><b>Actions: Done</b>: this report lists all Done actions within a specified

            in which area you are the most productive, performance of team members, etc. 
            The actions are grouped into sections: Do ASAP (ordered by ascending Done date), 
            Delegated (grouped by Delegate, ordered by ascending Done date), Inactive (ordered by 
            ascending Done date) and Scheduled (ordered by ascending Done date);</li>

                the pages selected as parameters in the PocketMod format.  
            See the <a href="pocketmod.html">PocketMod report help</a> for more details. There are two entries 
            for this report in the Reports menu so that you can design two pocketmod reports by selecting the 
            pages and remembering the options;</li>
            <li><b>Single actions</b>: this report lists all the actions which are not part of a 
            project. The Done State parameter allows you to select only current 
            actions (To do), or done actions or all. You can also choose a specific topic or context.

            You can include overdue actions or not. The start parameter allows you to produce 
            the report for today or tomorrow. If you select tomorrow, the report will list the 
            actions planned for tomorrow under the Today section and the week starting the day 
            after. The overdue actions are grouped into sections: Overdue Scheduled (ordered by ascending
            Scheduled date and time), Overdue Do ASAP (ordered by ascending Due date), Overdue Delegated 
            (grouped by Delegate, ordered by ascending Follow-up date). In the Today section, the Scheduled
            actions for today are first listed in ascending order of time, then the Do ASAP actions due today 
            grouped by context, then the Delegated actions to be followed up today group by delegate. In the This week
            section, all actions are listed together ordered by ascending date (and time for scheduled actions);
